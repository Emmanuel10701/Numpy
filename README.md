## Introduction

**NumPy** is a powerful library for numerical computing in Python. This walkthrough covers the **CRUD operations** that form the basis of array manipulation and data analysis. CRUD operations help you manipulate data programmatically and are fundamental when working with arrays in data science and scientific computing.

---

## Setup and Dependencies

Make sure you have the following tools and libraries installed on your machine:

- Python 3.x  
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab  
- NumPy  

### Install NumPy

If NumPy is not installed, you can install it using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy
````

You can launch Jupyter Notebook using:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

## CRUD Operations in NumPy

This section demonstrates how to perform **Create**, **Read**, **Update**, and **Delete** operations on NumPy arrays.

### Create Arrays

Use various NumPy functions to create arrays:

```python
import numpy as np

# Create array from list
arr1 = np.array([1, 2, 3])
print("arr1:", arr1)

# Create array of zeros
arr2 = np.zeros((2, 3))
print("arr2:\n", arr2)

# Create array of ones
arr3 = np.ones((3, 2))
print("arr3:\n", arr3)

# Create array with range of numbers
arr4 = np.arange(0, 10, 2)
print("arr4:", arr4)
```

---

### Read Arrays

Access specific elements, rows, or columns from NumPy arrays:

```python
arr = np.array([[10, 20, 30], [40, 50, 60]])

# Read single element
print(arr[0][1])  # Output: 20

# Read entire row
print(arr[1])     # Output: [40 50 60]

# Read specific column
print(arr[:, 2])  # Output: [30 60]

# Slice array
print(arr[0:2, 1:3])  # Output: [[20 30] [50 60]]
```

---

### Update Arrays

Modify the values of arrays using direct indexing:

```python
arr = np.array([5, 10, 15, 20, 25])

# Update single value
arr[2] = 100
print(arr)  # Output: [  5  10 100  20  25]

# Update multiple values
arr[1:4] = [200, 300, 400]
print(arr)  # Output: [  5 200 300 400  25]
```

---

### Delete Elements from Arrays

Use `np.delete()` to remove elements:

```python
arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])

# Delete element at index 2
new_arr = np.delete(arr, 2)
print(new_arr)  # Output: [1 2 4 5]

# 2D array example
arr2d = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]])

# Delete row 1 (second row)
new_arr2d = np.delete(arr2d, 1, axis=0)
print(new_arr2d)  # Output: [[1 2] [5 6]]

# Delete column 0 (first column)
new_arr2d_col = np.delete(arr2d, 0, axis=1)
print(new_arr2d_col)  # Output: [[2] [4] [6]]
```

---

## Conclusion

This walkthrough has demonstrated how to perform basic **CRUD operations** with **NumPy**, a core Python library for numerical computation. Mastering these operations is essential for effective data manipulation, analysis, and preprocessing tasks in data science and machine learning workflows.
